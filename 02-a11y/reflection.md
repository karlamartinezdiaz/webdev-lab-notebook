### Question 1 : Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the videos or the solutions for help?

Yes, I was able to complete this lab on my own. This one was a lot shorter so I was able to see all i needed to do on one page. 

### Question 2 : How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one exercise that was particularly helpful?

I found this section very helpful as I got to understand how to incoporate actions into the html files for the submit buttons. 

### Question 3 : Was there something that you wish had been explained better?

Nope, Catarina explained everything well. 

### Question 4 : Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this weekâ€™s topic a little better?

I would have liked to create my own personal form where I could play around with tags.
