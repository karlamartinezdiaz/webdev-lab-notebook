### 06-BOOTSTRAP

### Question 1 : Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the videos or the solutions for help?

I had to check solutions for this one as getting the cards to be formatted correctly was challenging for me. 

### Question 2 : How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one exercise that was particularly helpful?

this excersice was incredibly helpful to me as i found it very challenging ans learned a ton from it I like that most of the formatting was all done using html versus css, it helped me understand the diversity of html and what a touch of css can do. 

### Question 3 : Was there something that you wish had been explained better?

N/A

### Question 4 : Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this weekâ€™s topic a little better?

Nope, I just had to study it a bit more than the previous topics.
