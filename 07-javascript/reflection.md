### Question 1 : Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the videos or the solutions for help?

I had to use the solutions for a portion of these excersices since some of them I couldnt get the formatting right for. 

### Question 2 : How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one exercise that was particularly helpful?

The one excersice that I found to be helpful was dom. I still couldnt fully get it to work. At least not the way i think it is suppose to work. So i found it helpful in the sense that it challenged me very much. 

### Question 3 : Was there something that you wish had been explained better?

Not neccesarily. I wish I would have asked for help on the dom portion of this lab because i got stuck. 

### Question 4 : Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this weekâ€™s topic a little better?
