### Question 1 : Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the videos or the solutions for help?

No I did not but I did have to look to external sources to understand how flex worked and i feel as though this is a topic that I'll refer back to often.

### Question 2 : How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one exercise that was particularly helpful?

The excercises were a lot more challenging and I found that very helpful. There was only one excersize this lab so the whole excersise was helpful to me.

Nope, everything was explained well enough. 

### Question 4 : Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this weekâ€™s topic a little better?

Nope this excersice was challenging enough and helpful enough for me to understand.
