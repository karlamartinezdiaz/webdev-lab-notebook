### 03-CSS

### Question 1 : Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the videos or the solutions for help?

I needed to look for outside help for this one. I've worked with CSS before so I kind of knew what to expect although I did have to make sure I understood all the classes that where given to certain portions. 

### Question 2 : How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one exercise that was particularly helpful?

I found this section a lot more informative than the other ones. I was introduced to a lot of concepts regarding css and customizing my web pages. the one excercise i found to be most helpful was the layout portion of this lab.

### Question 3 : Was there something that you wish had been explained better?

Nope, Caterina explained it all very well. 

### Question 4 : Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this weekâ€™s topic a little better?

No this weeks topics were fun and easy to digest so i feel like I understood it well in the way it was taught.
