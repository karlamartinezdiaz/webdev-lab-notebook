## Reflection Document

### 01-HTML

### Question 1 : Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the videos or the solutions for help?

Yes, I was able to complete these on my own and then I went to Catarina's video to make sure I was on the same path of understanding. 

### Question 2 : How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one exercise that was particularly helpful?

This section was somewhat helpful but because it was HTML I didn't find it incredibly challenging. I did appreciate learning about all the tags that are available to me. 

### Question 3 : Was there something that you wish had been explained better?

No, Catarina explained everything very well and pasionately. 

### Question 4 : Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this weekâ€™s topic a little better?

I would have really enjoyed making my own "webpage" with the tools that Catarina gave us. I feel like having the ability to explore on my own would have been fun.
